    <p3 class="big_text" style="margin-top: 120px;">Ever since I was a kid I have loved playing video games. I think my favorite individual video game of all time would be Halo Reach. I played that game almost religously growing up. Growing up I played a ton of video games, which is pretty typical for my generation. So they hold a special place in my heart because some of my core memories growing up are playing video games with my neighbor hood kids or in middle school playing them with my school friends.</p3>

    <p3 class="big_text">When I was younger I hated sports and anything that had anything to do with them; however, as I grew up, I grew to appreciate working out more and more. Part of the reason I think that is, is because it brings consitency and helped grow my work ethic. Addititionally, working out also helps me get up in the morning because I find that working out in the morning helps me push myself mentally as well as physically, the reason behind that is because I know I struggle the most in the morning, so my logic is if I can the hardest and most exhausting part of my day out of the way right in the morning the rest of my day can only get better from there.</p3>

  <p3 class="big_text" style="align-content: center;">ever since middle I have been obsessed with the idea of DnD; however, I wouldn't find a group to play with until highschool. Once I got to highschool I pretty much played with the same group until I graduated; additionally once I graduated my DnD group essentiall fell apart. Since coming to college I haven't played pretty much any DnD; however, me and some of my friends I ade this year have started the process of planning out a campaign and I am very excited about it.</p3>
